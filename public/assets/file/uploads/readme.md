File UPLOADS go in this folder.  However, sometimes subfolders will need created to organize uploads.

It may be preferable to IGNORE this entire folder.

When setting up asset paths:

File System Path:  This is the relative URL: assets/img/uploads/

URL:  This includes the BaseURL (which you set in the config file): {baseUrl}/assets/img/uploads
